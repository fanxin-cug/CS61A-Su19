Consider an insect in an M by N grid. The insect starts at the bottom left corner,
(0, 0), and wants to end up at the top right corner (M-1, N-1). The insect is only
capable of moving right or up. Write a function paths that takes a grid length and
width and returns the number of different paths the insect can take from the start
to the goal. (There is a closed-form solution to this problem, but try to answer it
procedurally using recursion.)
